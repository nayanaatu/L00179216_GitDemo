# Value Stream Management

Value stream management enhances inter-team communication to optimize the flow of information and value generation. Typically, a customer initiates a feature request through sales or support channels, followed by product design by product teams, software development by engineering teams, and finally, product shipment. The inclusion of representatives from each team in a cross-functional setup expedites the delivery of the appropriate product, fostering efficiency and efficacy.

Value stream management addresses various challenges, including:

* Customer dissatisfaction with current offerings
* Slow turnaround time for bug fixes and new features or products
* Erosion of market share to competitors who swiftly adapt to market shifts
* Resource constraints stemming from layoffs and cost-cutting initiatives
* Suboptimal outcomes from Agile and/or digital transformations
* Limited visibility across the organization due to siloed structures and disparate data
* Organizational frameworks that do not prioritize value creation.
